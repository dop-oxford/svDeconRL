The repository contains the MATLAB codes requires to deconvolve a 2D image acquired with a system having a spatially variant point response. The deconvolution is based on a modified Richardson-Lucy algorithm with total variation regularisation to account for the spatially variant point response. Sample datasets are also provided.

* Code:
	- RLTV_SVdeconv.m: Function performing Richardson-Lucy deconvolution with total variation (TV) regularisation using a spatially-variant PSF model based on eigen-PSF decomposition.
	- TVL1reg.m: Function calculating the total variation regularisation factor for the RL algorithm using the L1 norm over the divergence of the array M 
	- ScriptLRTV.m:  Sample script iteratively calling the RLTV_SVdeconv() function for the given inputs over several number of modes, number of iterations, and TV coefficient values.
	- makeEdgeAtt.m: This function create a square array of amplitude 1 with the edges attenuated to zero using a cos function for a given number of pixels.

* Datasets:
	- Illumination focal spot image from From Fig. 4 in ref \[1\].
	- Bead image from From Fig. 5. in ref \[1\].
