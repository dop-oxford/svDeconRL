# svDeconRL
The repository contains the MATLAB codes requires for deconvolving a 2D image acquired with a system having a spatially variant point response. The deconvolution is based on a modified Richardson-Lucy algorithm with total variation regularisation to account for the spatially variant point response. Sample datasets are also provided.
